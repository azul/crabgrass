= Multilingual Support in Crabgrass

== Get multi-byte character encoding to work

In order to store multibyte unicode, run this:

  rake cg:convert_to_unicode RAILS_ENV=production

Now you should be able to store arabic, chinese, hebrew, etc.
This task only works with mysql. You should only have to do this once.

== Enable Localized User Interface

All crabgrass localizations are stored in RAILS_ROOT/config/locales/*.yml. The
name of the file is the code of the language. These localizations
will not appear for the user until they are enabled in the database.

To do this, edit this file, removing any languages you don't
want supported:

  config/db/languages.yml

Then run this command:

  rake cg:load_default_data RAILS_ENV=production

This will populate the languages table in the database. Now the files
in config/locales/*.yml will get picked up.

== Editing crabgrass UI translations

You can edit the UI translations in crabgrass using the translator plugin.
For information on how to use, see mods/translator/README

== Custom Translations for Sites

Each site has it's own folder in config/locales/sites. That folder multiple yml files, one file per language.

The name of the folder should be the name of the site. The folder should never contain a '.' (period) symbol! This will confuse the i18n module.

I18n module will look in here first for a translation key and if nothing is found, it will default to locales/lang.yml file.

Example structure:

config/
  locales/
    en.yml
    es.yml
    sites/
      examplesite/
        en.yml
        es.yml

### In config/locales/en.yml:
en:
  welcome_message: "Welcome to Crabgrass!"

### In config/locales/sites/examplesite/en.yml
en:
  examplesite:
    welcome_message: "Welcome to the Example Site!"

== Custom Translations for non-site Instances

Custom translations not associated with a site will only work if no sites are enabled in the crabgrass instance.  
The yml files for non-site custom translations should use the key "custom" as if it were a site name in the above example. 

Example structure:

config/
  locales/
    en.yml
    es.yml
    custom/
      en.yml
      es.yml

### In config/locales/en.yml:
en:
  welcome_message: "Welcome to Crabgrass!"

### In config/locales/custom/en.yml
en:
  custom:
    welcome_message: "Welcome to the Example Site!"
