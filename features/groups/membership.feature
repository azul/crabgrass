Feature: View People in Group
  In order to view the people in a group
  I can either:
  Go to that group's people page or,
  Go to that group's administration membership page.
  And I can see People according to letter. 

Background:
  Given a group: "diggers" exists with name: "diggers"
  And the following users exist:
    | user    | display_name | login   |
    | red     | Red!         | red     |
    | gerrard | Gerrard      | gerrard |
    | parsons | Parsons      | parsons |
    | blue    | Blue!        | blue    |

  And that group has the following members:
    | user    |
    | red     |
    | gerrard |
    | parsons |
    | blue    |

  And I am logged in as user: "blue"
